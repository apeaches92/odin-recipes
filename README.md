This is my first HTML project and I will be working on creating a recipe 
list. I will utilize the HTML boilplate as well as the <p>, <strong>, 
<em>, <h1-6>,<ol>, <ul>, <li>,  and potentially other tags for HTML use. I 
will initially create an index page and other directories to navigate to 
other pages (various recipes, about page, or other informative pages). 
This will test my skills at file organization as well.
